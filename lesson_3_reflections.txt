When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  It can be good as a backup, if your device becomes corrupt and you lost all your data, a copy will be stored in the cloud. This also allows you to share you code and allow other users to collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To prevent conflicts and to have more meaningful commits. An auto commit will have no relevance.
