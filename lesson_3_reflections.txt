When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  It can be good as a backup, if your device becomes corrupt and you lost all your data, a copy will be stored in the cloud. This also allows you to share you code and allow other users to collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  To prevent conflicts and to have more meaningful commits. An auto commit will have no relevance.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork is a clone from a github repository.
  Clone is a copy of a local or git repository.
  Branches are a copy of a master branch which can be edited separately away from the master branch. Can be merged back to master later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Means if your needing to go offline you have the latest version to work on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  It would be difficult to collaborate due to the code changing with no visibility. The only way i think it would work without git is using pair programming.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  It means we can make a change and then ask for this to be pulled into the master in github after a review of the owner. Also does not break the master code.
